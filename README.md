# Istacart_project
The project is part of the Career Foundry data analysis course. The focus is a fictious online company - Instacart - which operates through an app. The company has been pretty successful yet aims to gain further insight into its customers' profiles and sales trends. The data analysis uses Python. The analysis draws on a fabricated dataset and aims to derive insights that can contribute to new marketing and sales strategies for the company.
## Key Questions
The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day
are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times
when there are fewer orders.
They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend
the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use
simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product
orders.
The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
* What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?
* Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
* Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
* Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
## Key Results
* The Weekend is a key time for customers to pose orders, so any staff additions should be made for weekend days. Also, working hours from 9:00 to 17:00 are when the majority of orders are placed, so stocks and staff need to be fully prepared during those hours.
* During the times when customers spend more money, the order platform should make an effort to advertise higher cost products. On  the other hand, slower times of the day are a good opportunity to introduce promotions for key products that are higher in stock.
* Creating price ranges based on minimum and maximum values will help manage the range of prices for products and signal any time there is a product which is either extremely expensive or cheap. It will also help customers be prepared for the range of prices that they can count on and make better plans for their orders. 
* Considering that fresh produce are the most popular, the company should continue to invest in diversity and quality within this range of products. On the other hand, less popular products (e.g. pet food) can be advertised through client newsletters and pop-up messages at the order shop interface.
* Most customers are regular (they return between 10 and 40 times). It is important to have strategies to invite back these customers, for instance using a customised 'order card' in which after a certain number of orders, customers get a discount or a free item. This type of marketing strategy is important to convert regular into frequent customers, and non-frequent customers into regular ones. 
* Regular customers are the most important client base. Therefore, although loyal customers should be cared for (e.g., by providing a special discount or a cart), regular customers and new customers are the most important. All marketing strategies should cater to their needs, ensuring stocks of the most popular products. 
* Considering the differences between regions, it seems important to promote InstaCart in the Northeast and Midwest regions, for instance by offering regional products and local discount prices. On the other hand, the South and West are key markets that need to be supported by targeted marketing strategies, with focus on the more popular products, such as fresh produce, dairy and eggs. 
* The age of customers and their marital status are important in terms of spending habits. It is important to target marketing strategies and product offers to specific age groups, while also offering products that cater more to non-married/single adults, since these tend to order less, yet pay more for each order. Nevertheless, middle-size families, middle-age customers and married people make up the largest client base in terms of profile, so strategies that promote these customers' loyalty (e.g, discount carts, accumulation of points for discounts, etc.) are important. 
* The new classifications highlight differences in spending, frequency and loyalty accross customers. They can be used to promote specific products targeting small-size and/or large-families (who are less frequent customers), but also targeting different age and income groups, including the upper income group, which is on of the groups with less orders.
